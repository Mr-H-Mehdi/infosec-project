This project was built as Information Security semester project by Hussain Mehdi Kazmi, Bachelors of Software Engineering 2021-25, NUST.

In this project, I tried to implement a new kind of email, password login with 2FA. I generated device fingerprints for all unique devices, logged and monitored IP addresses and validate extensively each and every user.
